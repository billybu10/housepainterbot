# housepainterbot
## Short description
Simple bot for [friv's house painter](https://www.friv.com/z/games/housepainter/game.html) written in autohotkey.
Commented out part is responsible for starting next level(it's commented out cause you have to customize it for your device)

## How to run it
Install autohotkey(unfortunately available only for windows) and click my code two times.
You start the bot with `Ctrl`+`Win`+`Z` and stop with `Pause/Break`

## Customizing next level part
At the start of a new level, button, which has to be clicked, can spawn in to slightly different places. You have to write position of grey and green buttons into code in both cases. But don't worry, i created a tool which can help you. You run it just as any other ahk script. Then you place mouse cursor over the button and press `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`G`. Code outputs X and Y which you can type into the bot. After all the button position values are in the code you can uncomment that part.
